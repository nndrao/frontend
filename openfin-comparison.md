# Analysis: OpenFin Inter Application Bus vs Channel API

## Communication Model

The Inter Application Bus (IAB) is designed for direct peer-to-peer communication between applications. It uses a publisher-subscriber model where clients must subscribe to a provider with knowledge of what provider and topic to subscribe to.

In contrast, the Channel API provides an asynchronous request-response messaging channel. It follows a provider-client model where only one owner (channelProvider) exists per channel, but multiple clients (channelClient) can connect to it, creating bidirectional message pathways.

## Communication Style

The Channel API offers asynchronous methods that allow applications to complete events outside the main process flow, permitting multiple actions simultaneously. This helps speed up the connection process and eliminates manual tasking common with synchronous calls on the IAB.

The IAB, meanwhile, functions as "a messaging bus that allows for pub/sub messaging between different applications," with a focus on straightforward subscription-based messaging.

## Use Cases

The IAB is best suited for applications requiring direct peer-to-peer communication, such as auto-filling order books or auto-populating fields for spreadsheets or forms.

The Channel API is recommended for developers who want to employ asynchronous calls, establish two-way secure communication between themselves and clients, or provide a service on OpenFin.

## Performance Considerations

The Channel API now provides an "rtc protocol" option to isolate channel messaging from underlying OpenFin API IPC usage, improving performance. This protocol supports low-latency, high-frequency data streams by using the webRTC protocol.

Using IPC for extensive messaging "can negatively impact the performance and response time of all applications on the desktop," which is why the newer rtc protocol was introduced for Channels.

## Implementation

**IAB Implementation**:
The IAB offers methods like publish() to send messages to all subscribed applications on a topic, send() to target specific applications, and subscribe() to receive messages from specified applications.

**Channel API Implementation**:
A channel can be created with a unique name by calling Channel.create, which returns a promise resolving to an instance of the channelProvider bus. The provider can register actions and middleware, and set connection/disconnection listeners.

## Best For Publishing Large Amounts of Data Frequently

For publishing large amounts of data frequently, the **Channel API with RTC protocol** is the better choice because:

1. It provides an "rtc protocol" option specifically designed to support "low-latency, high-frequency data streams by using the webRTC protocol."

2. This protocol was created to isolate channel messaging from the underlying OpenFin API IPC usage, which directly improves the performance of channels.

3. Using the traditional IAB approach with IPC for extensive messaging "can negatively impact the performance and response time of all applications on the desktop," which is precisely why the newer rtc protocol was introduced for Channels.

4. The asynchronous nature of the Channel API provides an additional advantage, as it allows for multiple actions to be processed simultaneously without blocking the main thread.

## Implementation Approach for High-Volume Data

To implement this approach for high-volume, frequent data transmission:

1. Create a channel provider using the rtc protocol
2. Set up appropriate actions for data publishing
3. Have clients connect using the same rtc protocol

This configuration would provide the optimal performance characteristics for high-volume, frequent data transmission within the OpenFin ecosystem.
